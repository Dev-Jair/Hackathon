                Mission
            </h2>
            <p>
                Kami Online is a company made up of gamers. We excel because
                gamers rely on teamwork, are wicked problem-solvers and
                tenacious about reaching their goals, whether it's beating a raid
                boss or launching a product. Our mission is to keep on evolving and staying
                ahead of the curve by designing innovative top-of-the-line products and
                services-allowing gamers to fully experience their entertainment.

            </h2>
            <p>
                While evolving our procuts, we also want to evolve the whole company.
                By working on faster support resolutions, easy access to new learning
                systems and a great feedback system, we want to keep on investing
                in our staff. We understand that the backbone of the company is
                built by our employees. By investing even more time and energy in our own people,
                we can offer our customers a great gaming experience!

                Everything we do at Kami Online is based on the succes of the
                gaming experiences we provide our players. The goal of each
                discipline within the company -- be it art, programming or customer support --
                is to make our controllers as fun as possible for as many people
                as we can reach.

                We approach each task carefully and seriously. We seek honest
                feedback and use it to improve the quality of our work. At the
                end of the day, most players just want to enjoy their games and
                have fun each and everyday!

                Learn & Grow
            </h3>
            <p>
                The games industry is ever-changing. Technology improves, techniques
                change, and design philosophies become outdated. Since the founding
                of Kami Online, we've worked to improve through experience, teaching one another
                and cultivating the desire to be the best at what we do. We see this
                as an individual responsibility as well as a company one. Employees can
                count on their peers, managers, and the company itself to be supportive
                and help them gain the knowledge and training they need.
